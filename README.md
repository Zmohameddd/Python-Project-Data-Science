# Tesla and Gamestop Stocks Retrieval and Visualization

The **Tesla Stock and Revenue Visualization Project** offers an interactive view into Tesla's financial status, focusing on stock prices and revenues. It spans several steps:

- **Data Retrieval:** Utilizes `yfinance` to gather Tesla's historical stock and revenue figures.
- **Data Preparation:** Standardizes date formats across datasets using `pandas` for coherence in temporal analysis.
- **Visualization:** Employs `plotly` for dynamic, interactive charts that depict Tesla's financial trends over time.

Throughout the project, we leverage Python libraries like `pandas` and `BeautifulSoup` for data preparation and `plotly` for visualization, aiming to make Tesla's financial data easily understandable. The project addresses challenges such as data formatting and timezone localization to ensure accurate, insightful visualizations.
